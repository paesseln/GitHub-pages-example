            The idea here is that the root of the project gets published as github pages.
        Because there is no build step, this approach can only be used for static HTML, CSS and Javascript files.
        If you want to use a tool like 11ty, to publish a static site on Github Pages, its just not super easy.
        Instead you should look into publishing with Netlify.
